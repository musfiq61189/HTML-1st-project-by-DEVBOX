    <h1> HUMAN ENHANCED GREENHOUSE EFFECT</h1>
    <br>

    <br>

    <p>
        <b>There are three positions on global warming:</b> (1) that global warming is not occurring and so neither is climate change; (2) that global warming and climate change are occurring, but these are natural, cyclic events unrelated to human activity; and (3) that global warming is occurring as a result primarily of human activity and so climate change is also the result of human activity. <br>
        The claim that the observed global warming is natural or at least not the result of human carbon emissions (see Climate Skeptics below) focuses on data that shows that world temperatures and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> <b>(Carbon dioxide)</b>levels have been equally high or higher in the past. They also point to the well understood effects of solar activity on the amount of radiation striking the earth and the fact that in recent times the sun has been particularly active. <br>
        <b>The most commonly discussed GHGs are:</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                CO<sub>2</sub> or <b>(carbon dioxide)</b> is produced any time something is burned. It is the most common GHG, constituting by some measures almost 55% of total long-term GHGs. It is used as a marker by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, for example, because of its ubiquity. Carbon dioxide is assigned a GWP or Global Warming Potential of 1. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Methane</b> or CH<sub>4</sub> is produced in many combustion processes and also by anaerobic decomposition, for example, in flooded rice paddies, pig and cow stomachs, and pig manure ponds. Methane breaks down in approximately 10 years, but is a precursor of ozone, itself an important GHG. CH4 has a GWP of 28-36.</li>
            <li>Nitrous oxide in <b>parean</b> (laughing gas), NO/N<sub>2</sub>O or simply NOx is a byproduct of fertilizer production and use, other industrial processes and the combustion of certain materials. Nitrous oxide lasts a very long time in the atmosphere, but at the 100 year point of comparison to CO<sub>2</sub>, its GWP is 265-298.</li>
            <li><b>Fluorinated gases</b> were created as replacements for ozone depleting refrigerants, but have proved to be both extremely long lasting and extremely warming GHGs. They have no natural sources, but are entirely man-made. At the 100 year point of comparison, their GWPs range from 1,800 to 8,000 and some variants top 10,000.</li>
            <li><b>Sulphur hexafluoride</b> or SF<sup>6</sup> is used for specialized medical procedures, but primarily in what are called dielectric materials, especially dielectric liquids. These are used as insulators in high voltage applications such as transformers and grid switching gear. SF<sup>6</sup> will last thousands of years in the upper atmosphere and has a GWP of 22,800.</li>
        </ul>
